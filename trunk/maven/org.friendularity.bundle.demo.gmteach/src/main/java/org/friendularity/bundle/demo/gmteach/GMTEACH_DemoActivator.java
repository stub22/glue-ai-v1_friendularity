/**
 * This class is a bundle activator demonstrating how to start the Cogchar PUMA system, in an OSGi environment. We call such a bundle a "top" bundle, which is essentially a launchable application. This bundle can be launched using a maven command line like:
 * 
 * mvn -Prun-on-felix antrun:run
 * 
 * ...which is equivalent to a project->run command in Netbeans or Eclipse.
 * 
 * When the bundle is loaded (in activator "start"), it activates Log4J logging using forceLog4jConfig(), which assumes a "log4j.properties" file-resource is available on the classpath.
 * 
 * In principle, this bundle should start any desired subset of Cogchar functionality, for *any* environment, including
 * <ul>
 * <li>Cogchar behavior</li>
 * <li>Robokind animation and speech</li>
 * <li>Optional Cogchar OpenGL rendering</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The actual subset is determined through the mediation of a customizable PumaContextMediator object.
 * 
 * L1) This bundle does not try to start a lifter webapp, which is currently initialized orthogonally to the PUMA system. See the o.f.b.demo.liftoff project.
 * 
 * To exit, a user may X-closes our "main" simulator window, which calls stop on bundle 0.
