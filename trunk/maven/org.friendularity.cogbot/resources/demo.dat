Oh good. The news is so depressing.
why don't you ask me to read you a story
sure, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll. <silence msec="250"/> ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?" So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
TWO DUCKS AND A TURTLE - a Story from Buddhist Scriptures  The Story is from the Sutra of Parables, told by the Buddha in a sermon:  Once upon a time, there was a turtle living in a pond. Because of the very dry weather, the pond was drying up and the turtle got out of the pond to ask for help.  He saw two ducks passing by and shouted out, Help!  Would you please bring me to a pond full of water? How can we help you out? asked the ducks.  We are flying in the air and you are swimming in water.  I propose that both of you carry each ends of a piece of stick with you by your mouths, replied the turtle. Then I hold on to it at the middle with my mouth. You can then carry me to a pond full of water. That is a good idea, said the two ducks.  We will help you out. But you must remember not to open your month.  So, the duck carried the turtle across the country side toward the lake.  As they passed over a village, a group of children looked at them and bursted into laughter, Look!  What a funny sight!  Two ducks carrying a stick with a turtle holding onto it with his month!  The turtle was angry at the remark and reply, you guys are stupid.  What do you understand?  But, once he opened his month, he fell from sky and crashed to death.
ok no problem
I can recite from quite a few novels, including, Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays.  the Lost World a book by Arthur Conan Doyle.  Rainbows end by Vernor Vinge.  Alice In Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.  A Brief History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson.  the Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe a story by Daniel Defoe.  Jack Kerouac's on the road.  Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.   Valis by Philip K Dick.  Just ask me for one of these books by name, and I'll read it for you.
On the Road by Jack Kerouac.  <silence msec="200" /> I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that I won't bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that everything was dead. With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life you could call my life on the road.  Before that I'd often dreamed of going West to see the country, always vaguely planning and never taking off. </sapi></Step>
Rainbows End By Vernor Vinge. <silence msec="200" /> Prologue: DUMB LUCK AND SMART THINKING.The first bit of dumb luck came disguised as a public embarrassment for the European Center for Defense Against Disease. On July 23, schoolchildren in Algiers claimed that a respiratory epidemic was spreading across the Mediterranean.  The claim was based on clever analysis of antibody data from the mass-transit systems of Algiers and Naples.  CDD had no immediate comment, but in less than three hours, public-health hobbyists reported similar results in other cities, complete with contagion maps.  The epidemic was at least one week old, probably originating in Central Africa, beyond the scope of hobbyist surveillance.  By the time CDD got its public-relations act together, the disease had been detected in India and North America.  Worse yet, a journalist in Seattle had isolated and identified the infectious agent, which turned out to be a Pseudomimivirus.  That was about as embarrassing a twist as the public-relations people could imagine: Back in the late teens, CDD had justified its enormous budget with a brilliant defense against the New Sunrise cult.  The Sunrise Plague had been the second-worst Euro-terror of the decade.  Only CDD's leadership had kept the disaster from spreading worldwide.  The Sunrise Plague had been based on a Pseudomimivirus.   There were still good people at CDD. They were the same specialists who had saved the world in 2017.
