# If a given logger is not assigned a level, then it inherits one from its closest ancestor with an assigned level
# The output of a log statement of logger C will go to all the appenders in C and its ancestors. 
# This is the meaning of the term "appender additivity".
# However, if an ancestor of logger C, say P, has the additivity flag set to false, then C's output will be directed 
# to all the appenders in C and its ancestors upto and including P but not the appenders in any of the ancestors of P.
# Loggers have their additivity flag set to true by default.


# Here are the docs to control what is printed.
# Note that the file/method/line stuff only works if the Logger methods
# are invoked directly from application code.
